        Sri Lanka's unspoiled environment and diverse landscapes provide a wide range of outdoor and activity vacation options. Water-based activities such as diving and surfing are well-represented, and there are numerous other ways to stay active, including mountain biking, hiking, safari, trekking, ballooning, and yoga. Also watching a cricket match in Sri Lanka which is the most popular game in the country will give you a different experience than western sports events.
        <br> <br>
        Below are some of the most exciting activities you can engage doing in Sri Lanka, <br> <br>


        <h4>Surfing</h4> <br>

        <div class="photos">

        <br> <br>
        Most of the waves crashing against the Sri Lankan shore are coming all the way from Antarctica, so there are multiple good surfing places. The most popular Arugam Bay, on Sri Lanka's east coast, is such a surfing place with international recognition. Other popular surf spots include Midigama on the south coast, Medawatta (on the outskirts of Matara), and Hikkaduwa. You may hire a surfboard at any of these places. also, if you go to Arugam Bay or Hikkaduwa you can go on surfing trips along the coast. 
        they also include visits to see other interesting sights. The surfing season in Arugam Bay runs from April to October, and in Midigama and Hikkaduwa it runs from November to April.
        <br> <br>

        <h4>Watching A Cricket Match</h4> <br> <br>
        <div class="photos">

        </div> <br> <br>
        Go to see a cricket match if you have the chance, especially a one-day or a T20 because the hyped-up fans and the exciting carnival atmosphere are different from that calm sports environment you could see in western cricket matches. Cricket matches usually take place in Pallekele, Keththarama, Dambulla, Hambanthota, and sometimes at Sooriyawewa in Galle. You must purchase an entrance ticket available at the relevant venues and online. It's also worth noting that many of the tour companies we recommend, including Red Dot Tours, offer cricket tours to Sri Lanka.
         <br> <br>

        <h4>Whitewater rafting and other watersports</h4> <br>

        The Kelani River, which flows out of the Adam's Peak mountain and creates boulder-strewn grade 3–4 rapids, is the island's most popular whitewater rafting river. You can simply plan a rafting trip once you get to the place. Or you can pre-plan one online.
        <br> <br>
        The Bentota lagoon Sri Lanka's watersports hub is a great place for jet skiing,  water - skiing, speed boating, and stuff.  Windsurfing is also quite popular in this area. Also in Negombo, watersports may be organized through the hotels like "Jetwing Beach" which makes it a good choice hotel to spend your vacation.
        <br> <br>
        Kitesurfing is also another exciting watersport you can do in the country.
        Kitesurfers prefer to travel to the Negombo or Kalpitiya peninsulas, which offer excellent wind conditions and a mix of the open sea and sheltered lagoons. Wakeboarding is also gaining popularity. Along with Hikkaduwa, Negombo is one of the main centers.
        <br> <br>

        <h4>Diving</h4> <br>

        There are many underwater attractions in the country which makes diving very interesting. You are welcome to visit <a href=""> Dive Sri Lanka</a> which offers full details on Diving in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has several standardized diving schools in Beruwala, Hikkaduwa, Unawatuna, and Bentota, Sri Lanka also provides reasonably priced driving lessons.  Diving packages and lessons are very cheap compared to most other areas on the earth.

        <br> <br>

        On the west coast, there is a great network of diving sites. There's plenty of marine life, as well as some fantastic underwater cave and rock complexes and a bevy of wrecks, which you will be needing to have some technical support in order to explore. The East coast is rapidly opening up for new beautiful diving locations. You can also explore Beautiful wrecks like the "Hermes", a 270 meter-long aircraft carrier destroyed during World War II and sits at a depth of 60m near Batticaloa.
       <br> <br>

       The east coast's diving season is generally May to October, and on the west coast it is roughly November to April but, if you're a professional and if you're truly interested and don't mind diving in strong seas with low visibility, you can find some diving experts to take you on out season.
